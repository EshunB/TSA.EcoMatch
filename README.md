# EcoMatch

Project for the 2025 TSA National Competition.

This year's challenge was to develop a program that enhances the environment to be more sustainable. We decided to create a program called Eco Match. Eco Match helps customers find the perfect EV (electric vehicle) for their lifestyle.

When we first read the prompt, we were stuck for days and didn't have a clue what we should build. After a lot of research, we found out that EVs are one of the biggest ways that we can work to enhance environmental sustainability.

As more and more electric vehicles are hitting the market, it can be overwhelming for people to decide on which EV is best suited for their needs. The process of finding the right one might turn people away from buying an electric vehicle.

Our project utilizes a large database and a short but efficient quiz to help customers find the perfect EV car for them in less than two minutes.
